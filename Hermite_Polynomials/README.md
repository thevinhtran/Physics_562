# Recursive Functions: Hermite Polynomials 

Many important functions in physics are defined via recursion relations. Computationally, this allows us a neat way of generating the nth function building up from the beginning. One such example is the Hermite polynomial which is significant for being the solutions/wave functions to the quantum harmonic oscillator.
